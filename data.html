      Pittsburgh, what a generator of loneliness and tumult. Its predominantly African-American Hill District was the
      forcing ground of the playwright August Wilson, who paid such tender and respectful attention to lives there. The
      indispensable John Edgar Wideman was raised not far away, further east, in the city’s Homewood neighborhood. His
      postindustrial Pittsburgh is the locus of many of his novels and memoirs, and its texture and sociology burn a
      hole through the stories in “You Made Me Love You: Selected Stories, 1981-2018.” By the time Wideman was a young
      man, Homewood was pockmarked with burned-out stores and bent parking meters; he compares the houses to rotten
      teeth. "Somebody should make a deep ditch out of Homewood Avenue," he writes in one story, "and just go on and
      push the rowhouses and boarded storefronts into the hole. Bury it all."
